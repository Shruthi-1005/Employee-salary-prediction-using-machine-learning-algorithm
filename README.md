Employee Salary Prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict whether an employee's salary is above or below $50,000 per year based on demographic and employment data. The entire data analysis, model training, and evaluation process is detailed in the accompanying Jupyter notebook. The best-performing model is deployed in a user-friendly Streamlit web application.
Key Features:
->Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handles missing values, removes outliers, and eliminates redundant features to ensure a high-quality dataset.
->Feature Engineering: Applies label encoding to categorical variables and scales numerical features for optimal model performance.
->Model Training & Comparison: Trains and evaluates a variety of classification models, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, SVM, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
->Top Performance: The Gradient Boosting Classifier was identified as the best model, achieving an accuracy of approximately 85.62% on the test set.
->Interactive Application: A web app built with Streamlit allows for easy, real-time salary predictions.
